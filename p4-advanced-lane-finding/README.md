## Overview
The goal of this project is to improve the 'p1-finding-lane-line' project and to write a software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video from a front-facing camera on a car with higher accuracy including curved lanes.

Currently, this project is still yet to be uploaded, so check out the previous simple version of this project [here](http://code.tugan.me/finding-lane-line).
